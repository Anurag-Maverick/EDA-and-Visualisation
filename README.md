# EDA-and-Visualisation
In this repository, I am compiling a collection of projects that I have worked on during my journey in Data Science. This field is known for it's application of a variety of tools to solve different problems. As such, any data scientist is required to have a good experience in creating good visualisations and understand the features of data which can add to solve the mystery behind our data.

In python, primary libraries supporting visualizations are seaborn, matplotlib and Plotly. Also, I have tried to include some other lesser known libraries known for handling time series, spatial and other kinds of data.

Happy Learning!
